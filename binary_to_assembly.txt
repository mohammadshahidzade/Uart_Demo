Assume your binary file is named firmware.bin. Hereâ€™s how you would disassemble it:

Convert the binary file to an ELF file:

sh
Copy code
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -I binary -O elf32-littleriscv -B riscv firmware.bin firmware.elf
Disassemble the ELF file:

sh
Copy code
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -D firmware.elf
The output will show the disassembled instructions. For example:

yaml
Copy code
firmware.elf:     file format elf32-littleriscv

Disassembly of section .data:

00000000 <.data>:
   0:   00000137            lui     sp,0x0
   4:   00400093            li      ra,4
   8:   00000013            nop
   c:   00000013            nop
  10:   00000013            nop
Summary
By following these steps, you can convert a binary file to assembly language for a VexRiscv processor. This process involves converting the binary file to an ELF file and then using a disassembler to read the ELF file and produce assembly instructions.
